# Cache_Performace_Simulations
This repsoitory may serve as a getting-started guide for those interested in utilizying computer achitecture simualtors such as SimpleScalar and Gem5

# Getting Started
Follow the links and instructions in teh HOW_to files and you will be able to install and run your first simualtions in SimpleScalar and Gem5. The How_to files for SimpleScalar were created as part of assignments for a Micropcomputer Systems Class at Florida Internatioanl University (FIU), so there might be information specifically related to the assignments. However, if you follow the whole document you will get a better understanding of teh tools. The how_to for Gem5 is still in progress, but contains a lot of usefull information on how to install and run frist commands.

# Binaries
The "Binaries" files contains SPEC binaries for Gem5 and a matmul.c file that can be used in both Gem5 and SimpleScalar.


# Leveraging Python
The file contain a sample Python stcript written for Gem5 buit that can be adapted to SimpleScalr to perform optimization iterations. We used it to run different optimization paraments for Cache performance.


# Cahe Performce in Memory Hierarchy: A Cross-Simualtor Analysis using SimpleScalar and Gem5
This document was created as a result of a final class project for teh Class EEL5741: Advance Microprocessor Systems as FIU. This paper focusses on Cache Performance in Memory  Hierarchy and provides and cross-complier simulation analysis using two open source simulators: Gem5 and SimpleScalar. Memory hierarchy organization is a complex subject and requires the understanding of how all pieces interact together to provide the best possible performance. Cache performance is an important metric  in modern computer systems and it is considered to be crucial for many applications, specially real time applications. Thus, it is important to understand what parameters impact cache performance and how they do it. To help understand cache performance in memory hierarchy, this work explores cache performance through simulations using two different simulators: SimpleScalar and Gem5
